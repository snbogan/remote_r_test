# remote_r_test
A repository demonstrating how to use local R Studio with a remote directory through mounting

Slides from my 2/12/2025 Kelley Lab presentation on this workflow are available at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/184Vsh15X6Si1hbQ6Z8pZMUuBmXYV5hl6kgGzdx6N1Os/edit?usp=sharing).

These slides and the .Rmd file contain instructions for starting and executing this workflow to use local R Studio on a remote server.

Before you begin, consider cloning this repo and moving its contents to a remote working directory of your choosing. Alternatively, you can follow the instructions here to create your own repo to test the workflow, but I recommend creating a git version-controlled R project associated with your repo like I do here.
